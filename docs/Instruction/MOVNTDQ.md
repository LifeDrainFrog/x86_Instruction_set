# MOVNTDQ
 
## Store Double Quadword Using Non-Temporal Hint
 
 
|Opcode|Mnemonic|Description|
|-|-|-|
|66 0F E7 /r|MOVNTDQ m128, xmm|Move double quadword from xmm to m128 using nontemporal hint.|
 
## Description
 
Moves the double quadword in the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand) using a non-temporal hint to prevent caching of the data during the write to memory. The source operand is an XMM register, which is assumed to contain integer data (packed bytes, words, doublewords, or quadwords). The destination operand is a 128-bit memory location.
 
The non-temporal hint is implemented by using a write combining (WC) memory type protocol when writing the data to memory. Using this protocol, the processor does not write the data into the cache hierarchy, nor does it fetch the corresponding cache line from memory into the cache hierarchy. The memory type of the region being written to can override the non-temporal hint, if the memory address specified for the non-temporal store is in an uncacheable (UC) or write protected (WP) memory region. For more information on non-temporal stores, see "Caching of Temporal vs. Non-Temporal Data" in Chapter 10 in the IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1.
 
Because the WC protocol uses a weakly-ordered memory consistency model, a fencing operation implemented with the SFENCE or MFENCE instruction should be used in conjunction with MOVNTDQ instructions if multiple processors might use different memory types to read/write the destination memory locations.
 
 
## Operation
 
```c
Destination = Source;

```

|#NM|If TS in CR0 is set.|
 
## Real-Address Mode Exceptions
