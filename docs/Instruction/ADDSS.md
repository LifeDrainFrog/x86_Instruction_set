# ADDSS
 
## Add Scalar Single-Precision Floating-Point Values
 
 
|Opcode|Mnemonic|Description|
|-|-|-|
|F3 0F 58 /r|ADDSS xmm1, xmm2/m32|Add the low single-precision floating-point value from xmm2/m32 to xmm1.|
 
## Description
 
Adds the low single-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand), and stores the single-precision floating-point result in the destination operand. The source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The three high-order doublewords of the destination operand remain unchanged.
 
 
## Operation
 
```c
Destination[0..31] = Destination[0..31] + Source[0..31];
//Destination[32..127] remain unchanged

```
