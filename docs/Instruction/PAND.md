# PAND
 
## Logical AND
 
 
|Opcode|Mnemonic|Description|
|-|-|-|
|0F DB /r|PAND mm, mm/m64|Bitwise AND mm/m64 and mm.|
|66 0F DB /r|PAND xmm1, xmm2/m128|Bitwise AND of xmm2/m128 and xmm1.|
 
## Description
 
Performs a bitwise logical AND operation on the source operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand) and stores the result in the destination operand. The source operand can be an MMX technology register or a 64-bit memory location or it can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand can be an MMX technology register or an XMM register. Each bit of the result is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the first and second operands are 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.
 
 
## Operation
 
```c
Destination = Destination & Source;

```
 
 
## Flags affected
 
None.

 
 
## Protected Mode Exceptions
 
|[]()||
|-|-|
|#GP(0)|If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit. (128-bit operations only) If a memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, regardless of segment.|
|#GP(0)|If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit. (128-bit operations only) If a memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, regardless of segment.|
|#SS(0)|If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.|
|#UD|If EM in CR0 is set. 128-bit operations will generate #UD only if OSFXSR in CR4 is 0. Execution of 128-bit instructions on a non-SSE2 capable processor (one that is MMX technology capable) will result in the instruction operating on the mm registers, not #UD.|
|#NM|If TS in CR0 is set.|
|#MF|(64-bit operations only) If there is a pending x87 FPU exception.|
|#PF(fault-code)|If a page fault occurs.|
 
## Real-Address Mode Exceptions
 
|[]()||
|-|-|
|#GP(0)|(128-bit operations only) If a memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, regardless of segment. If any part of the operand lies outside of the effective address space from 0 to FFFFH.|
|#GP(0)|(128-bit operations only) If a memory operand is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, regardless of segment. If any part of the operand lies outside of the effective address space from 0 to FFFFH.|
|#UD|If EM in CR0 is set. 128-bit operations will generate #UD only if OSFXSR in CR4 is 0. Execution of 128-bit instructions on a non-SSE2 capable processor (one that is MMX technology capable) will result in the instruction operating on the mm registers, not #UD.|
|#NM|If TS in CR0 is set.|
 
## Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
 
Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode
|[]()||
|-|-|
|#PF(fault-code)|For a page fault.|
|#PF(fault-code)|For a page fault.|
 
## Numeric Exceptions
 
None.
